      <h1>NBA TRADE RUMORS</h1>
      <p>The Thunder hoped to unleash the 10-time All-Star as "Olympic Melo," a small-ball power forward capable of spreading defenses with pick-and-pop plays as well as spot-up opportunities. While Anthony did finish the 2017-18 season as one of the top catch-and-shoot scorers in the NBA, his efficiency took a major tumble â€” he shot a career-low 40.4 percent from the field.</p>

      <p class="big">That led to Anthony going off during his exit interviews about how the Thunder never put him in a position to succeed and forced him into a supporting role.</p>

      <p>"It wasn't no strategy to me being here, me being a part of the actual system and what type of player and things like that," Anthony said. "As far as being effective as that type of player, I don't think I can be effective as that type of player.</p>

     <p>"I think I was willing to accept that challenge in that role, but I think I bring a little bit more to the game as far as being more knowledgeable and what I can still do as a basketball player."</p>
